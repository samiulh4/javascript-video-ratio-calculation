# Event

`A JavaScript event is an action (signal) that is happens in the browser (system) and can be detected and handled by JavaScript.`

`An event is a signal that something has happened in the system (user action or browser action), and JavaScript can respond to it using an event handler or listener.`

User actions: (Event)
- click
- keydown
- submit
- mousemove
Browser actions: (Event)
- load
- resize
- scroll

When an event occurs (such as a click), the browser detects it and executes the JavaScript event handler attached to that event. The handler function receives an event object containing details about the event. Events are handled using event listeners, and they propagate through the DOM via capturing and bubbling phases.
